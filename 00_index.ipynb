    "This talk aims to advocate for more `educational` and `enjoyable` notebooks. Getting started with and using Jupyter Notebooks is easy and the sheer amount of Jupyter notebooks on Github is a testimony of it. However, just because one is using Jupyter notebooks does not mean that the workflow and code is understandable and structured at the same time. Making Jupyter notebooks more effective and educational for the community requires additional time, but with the help of key concepts it can easily be implemented. \n",
